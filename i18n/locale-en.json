	"about-headline": "About Konfetti",
	"about-a-headline": "Konfetti Vision",
	"about-a-text": "More than 800.000 people arrived in Germany in 2015 as refugees. Hence a lot of questions arose - both for people who arrived (newcomers) and receiving communities.In the first place we are strangers, because we differ in many ways, such as languages and especially experiences. Those differences can be exciting but create uncertainties, too, which eventually may cause prejudices. 'KonfettiApp' focuses on integration through joint experiences. By personal contact at eye level and shared experiences we aim at contributing to reduce these uncertainties. KonfettiApp therefore is the starting point for joint activities neighborhoods benefit from and better mutual understanding.",
	"about-b-headline": "What is the App for?",
	"about-b-text": "As a social task manager for local communities KonfettiApp helps pointing out relevant things that should be changed or improved in the neighbourhood. It helps to plan activities step by step, to distribute tasks, involve interested people, make arrangements and of course to reward actions with confetti. You want to welcome new neighbors from a foreign country and offer a language course but have no idea who could come and where it could take place? You just arrived in a new neighborhood and want to cook with new neighbours or meet people for soccer games but have no idea how to connect and who could participate? You work in an organisation that aims at integrating new neighbours and look for an innovative tool to organize activities or events? Then start the KonfettiApp and find other neighbors to push your ideas in the real world and make it happen.",
